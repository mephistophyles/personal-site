# Intro

I am the founder of Mokkapi, and several other projects. I've worked in machine learning, technical sales, partner management, and product, before running several business units at Adaptavist. I'm a strong believer in pragmatic agility, transparency, and a clear, good strategy. 

What time I have left is mostly devoted to my family, and incomplete DIY projects around my home. I live in the Boston area, have dual citizenship (Dutch and American), and am an avid hiker.
